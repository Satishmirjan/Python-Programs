print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are!\nUp above the world so high,\nLike a diamond in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle,little star,\nHow I wonder what you are!\nWhen the blazing sun is gone,\nWhen he nothing shines upon,\nThen you show your little light,\nTwinkle, twinkle, all the night.\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are!Then the traveler in the dark\nThanks you for your tiny sparke could not see\n which way to go,\nIf you did not twinkle so.\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are!")
